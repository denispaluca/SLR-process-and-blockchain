# Process and Blockchain - A Systematic Review
Blockchain technology has been proposed as a solution for business process management (BPM). In this context, the capabilities of blockchain can facilitate cross-organizational collaborative business processes. Despite the potential benefits, there are numerous challenges associated with the implementation of collaborative processes using blockchain. But, the potential of this technology has led many studies to be con- ducted in this topic. In this work, we review the current literature to understand the solutions offered by the research field to address these challenges. For this systematic literature review (SLR), 13 papers were selected from more than 1600 identified studies. The review focuses on recent improvements in four key areas: trust awareness, flexibility, temporal constraints, and process design. Overall, the findings of this review highlight the benefits of integrating blockchain into BPM, new challenges and the need for further research in this area.
