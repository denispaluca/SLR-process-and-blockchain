Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a {PRISMA} guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.},

As blockchain and other distributed ledger ({DLT}) are considered key enabling technologies, there is a need for supporting tools which can deploy business models over smart contracts in order to leverage these decentralized platforms. Existing blockchain-based Business Process Management ({BPM}) solutions support various blockchain platforms and different types of modelling language, i.e., Ethereum and Business Process Model Notation ({BPMN}). However, the majority of these methods do not support processes with time events and inclusive gateways due to severe limitations imposed by smart contract programming languages. In other words, mainstream blockchain platforms do not offer a straightforward way to execute a transaction at a later time. To overcome these aforementioned issues, we propose an engine called Pupa, a blockchain-based decentralized protocol to translate business processes with time events and inclusive gateways to smart contracts. Pupa accomplishes this by adding task feature to time events, check function on top of activities succeeding time events and, listening variables to sequence flow forking or joining inclusive gateways. We implemented Pupa by extending Caterpillar, an existing {BPMN} solution using Solidity and Ethereum, and evaluated the performance of our proposed engine and its generated smart contracts with a baseline solution. Our results show that Pupa is competitive with baseline solutions in terms of cost and performance, while offering additional advantages in terms of decentralization and supporting additional {BPMN} semantics.},

	abstract = {Blockchain ({BC}), as an emerging technology, is revolutionizing Business Process Management ({BPM}) in multiple ways. The main adoption is to serve as a trusted infrastructure to guarantee the trust of collaborations among multiple partners in trustless environments. Especially, {BC} enables trust of information by using Distributed Ledger Technology ({DLT}). With the power of smart contracts, {BC} enforces the obligations of counterparties that transact in a business process ({BP}) by programming the contracts as transactions. This paper aims to study the state-of-the-art of {BC} technologies by (1) exploring its applications in {BPM} with the focus on how {BC} provides the trust of {BPs} in their lifecycles; (2) identifying the relations of {BPM} as the need and {BC} as the solution with the assessment towards {BPM} characteristics; (3) discussing the up-to-date progresses of critical {BC} in {BPM}; (4) identifying the challenges and research directions for future advancement in the domain. The main conclusions of our comprehensive review are (1) the study of adopting {BC} in {BPM} has attracted a great deal of attention that has been evidenced by a rapidly growing number of relevant articles. (2) The paradigms of {BPM} over Internet of Things ({IoT}) have been shifted from persistent to transient, from static to dynamic, and from centralized to decentralized, and new enabling technologies are highly demanded to fulfill some emerging functional requirements ({FRs}) at the stages of design, configuration, diagnosis, and evaluation of {BPs} in their lifecycles. (3) {BC} has been intensively studied and proven as a promising solution to assure the trustiness for both of business processes and their executions in decentralized {BPM}. (4) Most of the reported {BC} applications are at their primary stages, future research efforts are needed to meet the technical challenges involved in interoperation, determination of trusted entities, confirmation of time-sensitive execution, and support of irreversibility.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00015},
	abstract = {The use of blockchain technology has been proposed to provide auditable access control for individual resources. However, when all resources are owned by a single organization, such expensive solutions may not be needed. In this work we focus on distributed applications such as business processes and distributed workflows. These applications are often composed of multiple resources/services that are subject to the security and access control policies of different organizational domains. Here, blockchains can provide an attractive decentralized solution to provide auditability. However, the underlying access control policies may be overlapping in terms of the component conditions/rules, and simply using existing solutions would result in repeated evaluation of user's authorization separately for each resource, leading to significant overhead in terms of cost and computation time over the blockchain. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that formulates a constraint optimization problem to generate an optimal composite access control policy. This policy is in compliance with all the local access control policies and minimizes the policy evaluation cost over the blockchain. The developed smart contract(s) can then be deployed to the blockchain, and used for access control enforcement. We also discuss how the access control enforcement can be audited using a game-theoretic approach to minimize cost. We have implemented the initial prototype of our approach using Ethereum as the underlying blockchain and experimentally validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

Blockchain has emerged as an effective solution for addressing several such challenges. However, the basic algorithms used in the business blockchain are not feasible for large scale {IoT} systems. To make them scalable for {IoT}, the complex consensus-based security has to be downgraded. In this article, we propose a novel lightweight proof of block and trade ({PoBT}) consensus algorithm for {IoT} blockchain and its integration framework. This solution allows the validation of trades as well as blocks with reduced computation time. Also, we present a ledger distribution mechanism to decrease the memory requirements of {IoT} nodes.

A literature survey, along with an analytical review, of blockchain-based supply chain research was conducted to better understand the trajectory of related research and shed light on the benefits, issues, and challenges in the blockchain-supply-chain paradigm. A selected corpus comprising 106 review articles was analyzed to provide an overview of the use of blockchain and smart contracts in supply chain management. The diverse industrial applications of these technologies in various sectors have increasingly received attention by researchers, engineers, and practitioners. Four major issues: traceability and transparency, stakeholder involvement and collaboration, supply chain integration and digitalization, and common frameworks on blockchain-based platforms, are critical for future orientation. Traditional supply chain activities involve several intermediaries, trust, and performance issues. The potential of blockchain can be leveraged to disrupt supply chain operations for better performance, distributed governance, and process automation. This study contributes to the comprehension of blockchain applications in supply chain management and provides a blueprint for these applications from the perspective of literature analysis. Future efforts regarding technical adoption/diffusion, block-supply chain integration, and their social impacts were highlighted to enrich the research scope.},

Furthermore, blockchain documents interoperation of workflow enactment services, such an audit trail can be used to depict a complete inter-organizational collaboration. Our approach comprises the combination of an interoperability interface and a general interoperability service. Interoperability service runs on a blockchain environment, and workflow enactment services can call interoperability service through their interoperability interface to communicate with each other.

To better understand the challenges at stake, this paper reviews the use of blockchain and {IoT} devices in cross-collaboration processes. This survey sheds some light on standard uses such as model engineering or permissioned blockchains which help adopt cross-collaboration business process management systems. Moreover, with respect to process design, two schools of thought coexist, addressing both constrained and loosely processes. Furthermore, a focus on data-centric processes appears to get some momentum, as many industries go digital. Finally, this survey underlines the need to orient future research towards a more flexible, scalable, and data-aware blockchain-based business process management system.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology enables the execution of collaborative business processes involving mutually untrusted parties. Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools do not provide mechanisms to cope with the flexibility requirements inherent to open and dynamic collaboration environments. In particular, existing tools adopt a static role binding approach wherein roles are bound to actors upfront when a process instance is created. Also, these tools do not allow participants to collectively make choices regarding alternative sub-processes or branches in the process model, at runtime. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. Furthermore, the paper introduces a model for consensus-based control-flow flexibility, wherein participants in a process can collectively agree on how to steer the business process within the boundaries defined by control-flow agreement policies. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles, control-flow elements, and policy constraints.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has emerged as one of the most promising and revolutionary technologies in the past years. Companies are exploring use cases in the hope of reaping benefits from this technology. However, to achieve the desired impact, it is not sufficient to merely replace existing technologies. Current business processes must be redesigned to realize benefits. This paper shows how a number of best practices for Business Process Redesign can be applied to leverage blockchain technology. Specifically, we adapt these best practices for redesigning processes intended to execute on blockchain. We further explore their applicability using a case study. The major elements of process redesign for blockchain are: (1) changing the view from intra- to inter-organizational processes by using the shared data ledger of blockchain, (2) using smart contracts performers of tasks and connectors of processes, (3) using blockchain as means for data communication, and (4) using tokens to manage digitally represented assets.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the advancing digitization and internationalization of business processes led to increasing inter-organizational collaboration. In such collaborative processes, different organizations work together towards a single objective. Usually, subprocesses carried out by one collaborator are beyond the domain of influence of all other collaborators. This leads to uncertainty regarding the execution of the collaborative business process. If collaborators still want to engage in the process, trust is needed. Several studies identified blockchain and distributed ledger technologies as a promising tool to enhance trust in business processes. Therefore, this paper proposes and analyzes a taxonomy of blockchain-based trust design patterns from a process-centric perspective. Process engineers can utilize the taxonomy as an overview of how the blockchain technology can enhance trust in collaborative processes.},

	abstract = {The usage of process choreographies and decentralized Business Process Management Systems has been named as an alternative to centralized business process orchestration. In choreographies, control over a process instance is shared between independent parties, and no party has full control or knowledge during process runtime. Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor and verify process instances during runtime for purposes of documentation, accounting, or compensation. To achieve business process runtime verification, this work explores the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to create a novel solution for choreographies. The resulting approach is realized in a fully-functional software prototype. This software solution is evaluated in a qualitative comparison. Findings show that our blockchain-based approach enables a seamless execution monitoring and verification of choreographies, while at the same time preserving anonymity and independence of the process participants. Furthermore, the prototype is evaluated in a performance analysis.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is of rising importance as a technology for engineering applications in cross-organizational settings, avoiding reliance on central trusted third-parties. The use of blockchain, instead of traditional databases or services, is an architectural choice in the development of a software system. Architecture impacts the non-functional qualities of systems, creating design trade-offs between these qualities. The costs of execution and storage are important non-functional qualities, but as yet little is known about them for blockchain-based systems. How expensive is it to use blockchains compared to conventional execution and storage infrastructure? We investigate this question using business process execution as a lens. Specifically, we compare the cost for computation and storage of business process execution on blockchain vs. a popular cloud service. Besides monetary cost, blockchains like Ethereum limit the complexity of new blocks by capping costs through network-defined limits. For applications using such blockchains, the limit per block, thus, translates into an upper bound on throughput scalability. First, we implement and measure the cost of business process execution on blockchain and cloud services for a business process model from a large-scale industrial dataset and an example from literature. We observe two orders of magnitude difference in this cost. Second, we illustrate how cost models can be used to project the impact of different workload assumptions. Finally, we discuss throughput scalability limits as well as trade-offs between cost and other non-functional qualities in the design of blockchain-based systems.},

	abstract = {The digitization of business processes makes it possible to automate and monitor their execution in real-time and thus to optimize them. However, for inter-organizational business processes the lack of trust and transparency between organizations makes it difficult to realize this potential. Distributed Ledger Technology addresses this issue by design, which makes it attractive as a platform for the execution of digitized inter-organizational business processes. In research, especially the mapping of standardized business process notations on smart contract definition languages is discussed recently, to ease the process development for different kinds of stakeholders. Within this work, we present an approach for the integration, execution and monitoring of modeled business processes based on Hyperledger Fabric’s chaincode. Our aim is the reduction of required knowledge about this framework for the integration of business processes in such systems. Therefore, we introduce a reverse translation approach to enable the monitoring of processes defined within a chaincode by providing {BPMN} 2.0 models, that specify business processes as graphical representations.},
