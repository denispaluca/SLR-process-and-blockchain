Stakeholders like developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts claim blockchain has the potential to reconfigure the contemporary economic, legal, political and cultural landscape. Skeptics claim the concept and its applications remain ambiguous and uncertain. Business scholars began publishing studies on the emergence and impact of blockchain, bitcoin, and related projects in 2014. In this study, we conduct a {PRISMA} guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society. We found that blockchain remains an early-stage domain of research in terms of theoretical grounding, methodological diversity, and empirically grounded work. We suggest research directions to improve our understanding of the state of blockchain and advance future research of this increasingly important and expansive area.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation of business processes faces a major hindrance due to the lack of trust and transparency. As blockchain and other distributed ledger ({DLT}) are considered key enabling technologies, there is a need for supporting tools which can deploy business models over smart contracts in order to leverage these decentralized platforms. Existing blockchain-based Business Process Management ({BPM}) solutions support various blockchain platforms and different types of modelling language, i.e., Ethereum and Business Process Model Notation ({BPMN}). However, the majority of these methods do not support processes with time events and inclusive gateways due to severe limitations imposed by smart contract programming languages. In other words, mainstream blockchain platforms do not offer a straightforward way to execute a transaction at a later time. To overcome these aforementioned issues, we propose an engine called Pupa, a blockchain-based decentralized protocol to translate business processes with time events and inclusive gateways to smart contracts. Pupa accomplishes this by adding task feature to time events, check function on top of activities succeeding time events and, listening variables to sequence flow forking or joining inclusive gateways. We implemented Pupa by extending Caterpillar, an existing {BPMN} solution using Solidity and Ethereum, and evaluated the performance of our proposed engine and its generated smart contracts with a baseline solution. Our results show that Pupa is competitive with baseline solutions in terms of cost and performance, while offering additional advantages in terms of decentralization and supporting additional {BPMN} semantics.},

	abstract = {Blockchain ({BC}), as an emerging technology, is revolutionizing Business Process Management ({BPM}) in multiple ways. The main adoption is to serve as a trusted infrastructure to guarantee the trust of collaborations among multiple partners in trustless environments. Especially, {BC} enables trust of information by using Distributed Ledger Technology ({DLT}). With the power of smart contracts, {BC} enforces the obligations of counterparties that transact in a business process ({BP}) by programming the contracts as transactions. This paper aims to study the state-of-the-art of {BC} technologies by (1) exploring its applications in {BPM} with the focus on how {BC} provides the trust of {BPs} in their lifecycles; (2) identifying the relations of {BPM} as the need and {BC} as the solution with the assessment towards {BPM} characteristics; (3) discussing the up-to-date progresses of critical {BC} in {BPM}; (4) identifying the challenges and research directions for future advancement in the domain. The main conclusions of our comprehensive review are (1) the study of adopting {BC} in {BPM} has attracted a great deal of attention that has been evidenced by a rapidly growing number of relevant articles. (2) The paradigms of {BPM} over Internet of Things ({IoT}) have been shifted from persistent to transient, from static to dynamic, and from centralized to decentralized, and new enabling technologies are highly demanded to fulfill some emerging functional requirements ({FRs}) at the stages of design, configuration, diagnosis, and evaluation of {BPs} in their lifecycles. (3) {BC} has been intensively studied and proven as a promising solution to assure the trustiness for both of business processes and their executions in decentralized {BPM}. (4) Most of the reported {BC} applications are at their primary stages, future research efforts are needed to meet the technical challenges involved in interoperation, determination of trusted entities, confirmation of time-sensitive execution, and support of irreversibility.},

	title = {Blockchain Based Auditable Access Control for Distributed Business Processes},
	doi = {10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00015},
	abstract = {The use of blockchain technology has been proposed to provide auditable access control for individual resources. However, when all resources are owned by a single organization, such expensive solutions may not be needed. In this work we focus on distributed applications such as business processes and distributed workflows. These applications are often composed of multiple resources/services that are subject to the security and access control policies of different organizational domains. Here, blockchains can provide an attractive decentralized solution to provide auditability. However, the underlying access control policies may be overlapping in terms of the component conditions/rules, and simply using existing solutions would result in repeated evaluation of user's authorization separately for each resource, leading to significant overhead in terms of cost and computation time over the blockchain. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that formulates a constraint optimization problem to generate an optimal composite access control policy. This policy is in compliance with all the local access control policies and minimizes the policy evaluation cost over the blockchain. The developed smart contract(s) can then be deployed to the blockchain, and used for access control enforcement. We also discuss how the access control enforcement can be audited using a game-theoretic approach to minimize cost. We have implemented the initial prototype of our approach using Ethereum as the underlying blockchain and experimentally validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

These systems, including industrial, healthcare, and others, are large scale complex networks of heterogeneous devices. This introduces many security and access control challenges. Blockchain has emerged as an effective solution for addressing several such challenges. However, the basic algorithms used in the business blockchain are not feasible for large scale {IoT} systems. To make them scalable for {IoT}, the complex consensus-based security has to be downgraded. In this article, we propose a novel lightweight proof of block and trade ({PoBT}) consensus algorithm for {IoT} blockchain and its integration framework. This solution allows the validation of trades as well as blocks with reduced computation time. Also, we present a ledger distribution mechanism to decrease the memory requirements of {IoT} nodes. The analysis and evaluation of security aspects, computation time, memory, and bandwidth requirements show significant improvement in the performance of the overall system.},

This paper defines precisely the social dimension to be taken into account in BPM and recommends a set of models to structure the design and development of Social BPM. In addition, a social ontology has been developed with Protege 5.0 and rules for inferring knowledge and queries for exploiting it have been implemented with SWRL and SPARQL.}

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

A literature survey, along with an analytical review, of blockchain-based supply chain research was conducted to better understand the trajectory of related research and shed light on the benefits, issues, and challenges in the blockchain-supply-chain paradigm. A selected corpus comprising 106 review articles was analyzed to provide an overview of the use of blockchain and smart contracts in supply chain management. The diverse industrial applications of these technologies in various sectors have increasingly received attention by researchers, engineers, and practitioners. Four major issues: traceability and transparency, stakeholder involvement and collaboration, supply chain integration and digitalization, and common frameworks on blockchain-based platforms, are critical for future orientation. Traditional supply chain activities involve several intermediaries, trust, and performance issues. The potential of blockchain can be leveraged to disrupt supply chain operations for better performance, distributed governance, and process automation. This study contributes to the comprehension of blockchain applications in supply chain management and provides a blueprint for these applications from the perspective of literature analysis. Future efforts regarding technical adoption/diffusion, block-supply chain integration, and their social impacts were highlighted to enrich the research scope.},

Workflow enactment services communicate and interoperate with each other via blockchain instead of trusting a central authority, but trust is maintained. Furthermore, blockchain documents interoperation of workflow enactment services, such an audit trail can be used to depict a complete inter-organizational collaboration. Our approach comprises the combination of an interoperability interface and a general interoperability service. Interoperability service runs on a blockchain environment, and workflow enactment services can call interoperability service through their interoperability interface to communicate with each other. We implement the prototype of our approach and demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to an inter-organizational collaboration case. We evaluate our approach mainly via conducting a performance evaluation.},

Nevertheless, a decentralized monitoring facility such as a blockchain-based and Internet-of-Things-aware ({IoT}-aware) business process management system can reduce this pitfall. However, concerns related to usability, privacy, and performance, hamper the wide adoption of these systems. To better understand the challenges at stake, this paper reviews the use of blockchain and {IoT} devices in cross-collaboration processes. This survey sheds some light on standard uses such as model engineering or permissioned blockchains which help adopt cross-collaboration business process management systems. Moreover, with respect to process design, two schools of thought coexist, addressing both constrained and loosely processes. Furthermore, a focus on data-centric processes appears to get some momentum, as many industries go digital. Finally, this survey underlines the need to orient future research towards a more flexible, scalable, and data-aware blockchain-based business process management system.},

Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools do not provide mechanisms to cope with the flexibility requirements inherent to open and dynamic collaboration environments. In particular, existing tools adopt a static role binding approach wherein roles are bound to actors upfront when a process instance is created. Also, these tools do not allow participants to collectively make choices regarding alternative sub-processes or branches in the process model, at runtime. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. Furthermore, the paper introduces a model for consensus-based control-flow flexibility, wherein participants in a process can collectively agree on how to steer the business process within the boundaries defined by control-flow agreement policies. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles, control-flow elements, and policy constraints.},

To achieve business process runtime verification, this work explores the suitability of the Bitcoin blockchain to create a novel solution for choreographies. The resulting approach is realized in a fully-functional software prototype. This software solution is evaluated in a qualitative comparison.

	abstract = {Blockchain is of rising importance as a technology for engineering applications in cross-organizational settings, avoiding reliance on central trusted third-parties. The use of blockchain, instead of traditional databases or services, is an architectural choice in the development of a software system. Architecture impacts the non-functional qualities of systems, creating design trade-offs between these qualities. The costs of execution and storage are important non-functional qualities, but as yet little is known about them for blockchain-based systems. How expensive is it to use blockchains compared to conventional execution and storage infrastructure? We investigate this question using business process execution as a lens. Specifically, we compare the cost for computation and storage of business process execution on blockchain vs. a popular cloud service. Besides monetary cost, blockchains like Ethereum limit the complexity of new blocks by capping costs through network-defined limits. For applications using such blockchains, the limit per block, thus, translates into an upper bound on throughput scalability. First, we implement and measure the cost of business process execution on blockchain and cloud services for a business process model from a large-scale industrial dataset and an example from literature. We observe two orders of magnitude difference in this cost. Second, we illustrate how cost models can be used to project the impact of different workload assumptions. Finally, we discuss throughput scalability limits as well as trade-offs between cost and other non-functional qualities in the design of blockchain-based systems.},

Thus, Blockchain technology can be used to find agreement between untrusted collaborating parties in business processes. However, temporal constraints of processes need more investigation. Indeed, Blockchain platforms do not offer means to represent nor to manage temporal constraints for business processes. Moreover, transaction completion time is not fixed, it can take from a few seconds to several minutes. In this paper, we include temporal constraints in smart contracts, which could mitigate the violation of time constraints, minimize the costly execution time, and avoiding thus financial penalties. To achieve this, we extend Caterpillar tool, which is the first open-source blockchain-based {BPMN} execution engine, to enable the automatic transformation of a large set of temporal constraints for business process model to smart contract code.

	abstract = {The execution of multi-party business processes on blockchains has been more and more used in the last years in those contexts where trust among the involved parties is a crucial requirement that cannot be assumed by default. The immutability, transparency, and decentralised characteristics of the blockchain ensure the parties' responsibility in case of controversial actions. However, if on the one hand, the immutable nature of the blockchain brings many benefits from the trust perspective, on the other hand such rigidity leads to a lack of flexibility in the execution of blockchain-based business processes. In this paper, we face the challenge of making flexible the execution of multi-party business processes based on blockchain. We propose an approach that exploits the {BPMN} choreography model to describe a multi-party business process. From the model it is produced an on-chain smart contract storing the current state of the execution, and an off-chain rule-based program implementing the choreography logic. The decoupling of the execution state from the choreography logic allows achieving the flexibility of the multi-party interactions. We provide an implementation of the approach, the {FlexChain} framework, that relies on the Ethereum permissionless blockchain, hence on Solidity smart contracts, and on Drools as an off-chain rules engine. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution through a case study representing the procedure for a career upgrade, whose experiments have been conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.},

The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named {ChorChain}. More specifically, {ChorChain} takes as input a {BPMN} choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, {ChorChain} also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, {ChorChain} enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure.

In this paper, we propose {CoBuP}, a decentralized Collaborative Business Process execution architecture using blockchain. To address the inflexibility issue, this paper presents an interpreter of {BPMN} process models, supporting the instantiating, execution, monitoring of process instances. For this reason, one generic smart contract is deployed once, which helps generate a process instance, create {BPMN} elements by invoking the process instance predefined functions, and dynamically update the adaptation of a process at run time. For validation purposes, two use cases have permitted to carry out different experiments that demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach. The obtained results of the experimental evaluation shows that our approach cost is similar or lower than that of the existing approaches.},

abstract="Inter-organizational business processes involve different independent participants to interact with each other to run a collaborative business process. To date, central, trusted third parties mediate between non-trusting participants adding additional process complexity as well as administrative and run costs. Recent research showed that Blockchain and Smart Contracts can replace the role of a central trusted authority in collaborative execution of processes. Smart Contracts, that represent business process logic, cannot be altered due to immutability constraints of Blockchain systems. Yet, with the help of advanced technical upgradeability concepts, upgrading contracts, therefore enabling versioning of processes on a Blockchain is possible. This paper analyzes and implements three different upgradeability concepts. The implemented patterns are evaluated with regard to an existing blockchain-based execution framework for inter-organizational business processes. Our findings suggest the Unstructured Storage Proxy pattern to be the most promising for practical use, especially regarding cost-effectiveness and minimal added complexity. The findings are derived from simulations on a real-world use case stemming from a large German electronics manufacturing company.",
